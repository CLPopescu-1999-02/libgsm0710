A lightweight implementation of the 3GPP GSM 07.10 Multiplexing Protocol.

If you want to have a full fledged GSM Multiplexer, you might want to
use the fso-abyss project, which adds forwarding virtual channels
through ptys and has a dbus controlling interface.

Feel free to use this library to create other kinds of frontends.
