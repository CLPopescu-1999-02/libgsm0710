A lightweight implementation of the 3GPP GSM 07.10 Multiplexing Protocol.

If you want to have a full fledged GSM Multiplexer, you might want to
use libgsm0710mux which adds serial and pty transports to it, or even
fso-abyss, which has a dbus controlling interface.

Feel free to use this library to create other kinds of frontends.
